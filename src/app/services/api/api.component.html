                        does it manage to link the information from another system to its own?</p>
                    <p> Well—it’s not rocket science—it’s just <b>API</b> or <b>Application Programming Interface.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>An Application Programming Interface is a program that communicates between two different
                        applications and simplifies the building process. Application Programming Interface has ample
                        room for innovation as it helps the developers to bridge the gap between two different apps, or
                        it can also help businesses to collaborate. But, how does this really help?</p>
