                                If you are an avid reader, you may be familiar with the term <b>‘Bookmarking’</b>. 
                                Just like we bookmark our favourite page in a physical book, bookmarking in the 
                                digital world means exactly the same. It is also called as <b>Social Bookmarking</b>.
                        </p><p>
                                We normally send food tips like nutrition facts and which dish to eat for better diet etc., 
                                to our friends and family; but what we don’t know here is that we are inadvertently 
                                taking part in Social Bookmarking. In simple words, the process of sharing and tagging 
                                webpages is called <b>Social Bookmarking</b>.

                                    There are a few famous websites that you might have heard of but barely knew that they 
                                    are a <b>social bookmarking website</b>, like Pinterest, Bitly, Evernote, Delicious, etc. 
                                    There are end numbers of webpages that are bookmarked in food category because we tend
                                     to read, watch and share food video.
                               </p> <p>
                                      These websites keep a track of bookmarked pages so 
                                     that it is simple for its users to find valuable information. They categorise 
                                     bookmarked websites in sections like technology, science, travel, food, politics, etc.,
                                      which also helps in terms of SEO in the long run.
