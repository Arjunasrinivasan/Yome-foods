                                It is safe to say that <b>blogging</b> was the first step towards the cosmic web of social media and 
                                digital marketing. Before social media, blogging was the only way to pen your thoughts and 
                                share it with others, which is now on your fingertips. There are umpteen food bloggers who 
                                blog about recipes, nutrition facts and best dish in different restaurants. But how is blogging
                                 going to help you from a business standpoint of view?
                        </p><p>        
                                 <b>Blogging</b> about a dish for a restaurant can really boast your webpage because people are interested
                                 in knowing where the best food in their location is, and helps you to attract more traffic 
                                 and divert more audience to your website. People who read food blogs or who needs some 
                                 information about some dish or restaurant will land on your blog page and this will help you 
                                 to churn these readers into potential customers.

                                    <b>Blogging</b> also helps in SEO; if your website has an ample amount of content—blogs—with proper
                                     SEO, it is easy to stumble upon your webpage rather than any other. E.g., if someone is 
                                     looking for some local delicacy, and you have a blog with the same keywords, it is highly 
                                     possible that the reader will land your website because your SEO is strong and correct.
                                      In this way, 
                                    you will gain traffic and the reader will learn the information that he/she is looking for
