<p>A website is the landing page of your restaurant where customers can learn any kind of information about your
    restaurant. From your restaurant’s speciality to discounts and bookings, everything should be up-to-date.
    Creating a website is as similar as designing a logo; it needs proper User Interface that can help the viewer to
    access the webpage. A website should include a distinctive menu, offers, location, speciality, alternative cuisine,
    etc., which will give complete information about the restaurant.
    Apart from the user interface of the webpage, there is another aspect that one needs to keep in mind. While making a
    good website for your restaurant, always keep in mind the SEO aspect too. This helps in ranking your website on the
    search engine; higher the rank, higher the visibility of your restaurant.
    A successful webpage can also include comment’s section and customer’s photos which you can upload on your
    website—after taking customer’s permission—this can help you to know how your customers vision your restaurant. A
    website’s impression can either let the customer remain on your website or let them turn to your competitor.
