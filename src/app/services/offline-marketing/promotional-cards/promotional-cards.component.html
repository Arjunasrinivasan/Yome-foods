<p>We see promotional cards nowadays everywhere. This is another marketing strategy that provokes the customer to visit
    your restaurant again and again.
    Do you recollect any promo codes that you may have received from Zomato or Swiggy? Bingo! That is exactly what we
    are talking about; these promo codes basically encourage the existing customer to spend more on their website or app
    with the help of a promo code. It does not only encourage existing customers but also new customers.
    Unbelievable discount, free sides on main course, free drinks on order value up to certain amount, referring your
    friends or family for vouchers etc., these kinds of offers will entice your customers and make them visit or order
    from your restaurant very often.
    Promo codes are very successful during the times of festivals or grand opening to create awareness about the brand
    and increase the sales. These cards normally have an expiry date, which ensures that the customer will visit your
    restaurant before that date. The customer gets a discount and the company gets sales; it is a win-win situation.</p>
