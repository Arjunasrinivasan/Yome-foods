                        contact information of a specific person with the restaurant's details. They are shared during 
                        a customer's visit as a memory aid.
                    </p>

                    <p>Visiting cards are an essential part of marketing, looking at its size and cost, it is the best 
                        way to promote your restaurant. When the food you prepare is delicious, people tend to remember your 
                        restaurant by the taste and there are high chances that they can give you bulk orders or take you
                        in for some catering purpose. This will be possible only if they remember your restaurant's name;
                        for that purpose, we have a visiting card. As visiting cards are short and sweet, you cannot expect
                         it to tell the entire story, but at least that person can remember that they visited your restaurant
                          and these cards can leave a memorable impact too.
